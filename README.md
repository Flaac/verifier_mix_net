# verifier_mix_net
Soon be released

## Project

This project is about implementing a stand alone verifier for the Verificatum Mix-Net. This mix-net is El Gamal-based and uses the Fiat-Shamir heuristic to produce a proof that the software of this project will be able to verify. 

More information about the mix-net can be found :

This implementation is based on one document : 

## Implementation

This implementation is in C++ using GMP (for handling huge numbers), RapidXML (to parse XML) and OpenSSL for a more advanced and secure implementation of the SHA-2 algorithm than mine (cf krypto16).
